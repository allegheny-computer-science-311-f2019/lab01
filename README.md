# lab01_cs311f2019

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this
repository contains the starter files for Laboratory 1 assignment in Computer Science 311.

## Summary
This laboratory assignment invites you to work in a team to implement an ethical
and aggressive robotic behavior while learning how to write programs using leJOS
on Lego EV3 robots.  Using EV3 motors and sensors, your designed robot will
participate in the robotic field day racing competitions during the next lab session.
Finally, you are also responsible for writing a detailed report,
stored in the file `writing/reflection.md`. This is a Markdown file that must
adhere to the standards described in the [Markdown Syntax
Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Available for download at the course website [course
website](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/jjumadinova/teaching/311/labs.html),
the carefully formatted assignment sheet for this project provides more details
about the steps that a computer scientist should take to complete this
assignment.

## Learning
To learn about ethical and aggressive robots please read an article titled [Why Ethical Robots Might Not Be Such a Good Idea After All](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/artificial-intelligence/why-ethical-robots-might-not-be-such-a-good-idea-after-all) by Alan Winfield.

To complete the necessary  installations on your machine to work with leJOS, please follow the [leJOS tutorials](https://sourceforge.net/p/lejos/wiki/Home/). To learn how to program an EV3 robot using leJOS, please consult [leJOS API](http://www.lejos.org/ev3/docs/).

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub
Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features
that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the
following GitHub guides: [Mastering
Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello
World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your
Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these
guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and
[GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).

## Assistance

If you are having trouble completing any part of this project, then please talk
with  the course instructor during the laboratory
session. Alternatively, you may ask questions in the Slack team for this
course. Finally, you can schedule a meeting during the course instructor's
office hours.
